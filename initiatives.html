                    <p>For more photos, check out <a href=events.html#event-coffee>this page</a>! Our 1-meter coffee shop, set up within Pook's workplace, provides employment for individuals with autism as baristas. The baristas undergo training before they are qualified to work and make coffees, and are paid a monthly salary. This is a collaborative initiative between Shanghai Pook Data Technology (Group) Co., Ltd and Blue Harbor, aimed to provide its office space for employment of workers with autism from the Shanghai Blue Harbor Autism Youth Development Center as baristas running the cafe. Workers follow guidelines that align with normal business operations at Pook. Through this project, we created opportunities for individuals with autism for employment and hands-on experience.</p>

                    <p>Check out <a href=events.html>events</a> to see our farm! The sustainable farm project is an initiative that brings together Blue Harbor, Shanghai Puguan Ecological Agriculture Co., Ltd., and Yunshi Intelligent Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. This partnership aims to promote "planting de-chemicalization" and "breeding de-antibiotics" while restoring the original taste of food, while providing employment and fruits for individuals with autism. Blue Harbor mobilizes families with autism and international schools to participate in farm activities at Puguan's farm. Puguan's farm is known for its high-quality Pinguanfeng grapes, and they provide the land and grape varieties, allowing us to host community and sale events. Yunshi Intelligent Technology supports our collaboration by providing technological expertise and promoting food safety standards.</p>
